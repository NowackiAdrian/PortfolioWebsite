					<h1>From Physio Tables to Data Tables</h1>
					<p>I began my journey on the football field, where small details often made the biggest difference.
						Later, as a massage therapist, I supported others — tailoring treatments to each individual.
						Today, I bring that same mindset into the world of data: focused, precise, and human-centered.
						I'm currently studying Computer Science with a specialization in databases, aiming to grow into
						a data-driven career.</p>

				<p>My journey started on the football pitch. At 15, I left my hometown to join the youth system of
					Zagłębie Lubin, a Polish top-tier football club, where I trained and competed on a professional
					level for several years. That experience taught me discipline, resilience, and the importance of
					details — because in sports, tiny margins often decide the outcome.</p>

				<p>After finishing a 2.5-year vocational program, I became a certified massage therapist. I completed
					two internships, including one back at Zagłębie, working closely with athletes and learning how to
					approach each person individually. This led me to Denmark, where I opened my own massage studio.
					Managing client records and therapy notes made me realize just how powerful structured information
					can be. That was my first real encounter with the value of data.</p>

				<p>When the pandemic forced me to close my business, I took on a new challenge as a shift leader in a
					supermarket, where I honed my people management skills. Around that time, I made a decision to fully
					transition into tech — and began studying Computer Science at the Polish-Japanese Academy of
					Information Technology in Warsaw, with a specialization in databases.</p>

				<p>Today, I'm focused on building a career in data. Whether it’s engineering robust data pipelines,
					analyzing datasets, or uncovering insights that support decision-making — I see data as a tool to
					improve processes, support people, and drive business value. I’m currently looking for opportunities
					as a Data Engineer, Data Analyst, or Data Scientist to take that next big step.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Beyond the Data: A Bit More About Me</h2>

				<p>
					<span class="image left"><img src="images/Malta.JPG" alt="Backpacking trip in Malta" /></span>
					Traveling has been a big part of my life. I've taken several solo backpacking trips across Europe,
					often without a strict plan — just a backpack, a camera, and curiosity. These journeys have led me
					to some incredible people and places, and I always carry my trusty 80s film camera to capture the
					quiet, raw moments along the way.

					Books are another constant. Since I was a kid, I’ve always had one with me — whether I’m commuting,
					taking a break between tasks, or winding down for the night. I tend to gravitate toward 20th-century
					classics — authors like Camus, Dostoevsky, Orwell, or Ayn Rand. I don’t really stick to one genre,
					but I love stories that explore the human condition and make me think. These passions help me
					recharge and stay curious — two things that I think are just as important in data work as they are
					in life.
