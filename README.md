## About the Site

This repository contains the **entire source code** for my personal data‑focused portfolio.  
It serves three main goals:

- **Showcase** selected data projects (SQL, Power BI, Python, Data Warehousing)  
- **Present** certifications and academic achievements  
- **Provide** an easy way to contact me for freelance or full‑time/part‑time roles

Created with recruiters and hiring managers in mind, the site offers a clear, structured overview of my skills, real‑world projects, and technical focus areas.
